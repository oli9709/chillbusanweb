# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Comment Section Not Visible

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**
Your Netlify is deploying the React build (`chill-busan-tours/dist`) instead of the HTML file with the comment section. The comment section exists in `/index.html` but Netlify is serving the React app.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**
I've updated `netlify.toml` to deploy the correct files:

**Before:**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "chill-busan-tours/dist"
  command = "cd chill-busan-tours && npm run build"
```

**After:**
```toml
[build]
  publish = "."
  command = "echo 'No build needed - using static HTML'"
```

## 🚀 **Deploy the Fix:**

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Deploy static HTML instead of React build to show comment section"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Wait for Netlify deployment** (usually takes 2-3 minutes)

3. **Test your live site:**
   - Visit `chillbusantours.com`
   - Scroll down to see the comment section
   - Open browser console (F12) to see debugging messages

## 🔍 **What to Expect After Deployment:**

1. **Comment section will be visible** at the bottom of the page
2. **Console messages** will show:
   - "DOM loaded, initializing comments..."
   - "Comment elements found: {commentsSection: true, ...}"
   - "CommentsManager initialized successfully"

3. **You can test commenting** (functions should work on live site)

## 📋 **Files That Will Be Deployed:**
- ✅ `index.html` (with comment section)
- ✅ `main.js` (with comment functionality)
- ✅ `style.css` (with comment styles)
- ✅ `netlify/functions/comments.js` (backend)
- ✅ All images and assets

## 🆘 **If Still Not Working:**

1. Check Netlify build logs for any errors
2. Verify the Functions tab shows your `comments` function
3. Check browser console for any error messages
4. Ensure `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is set in Netlify

The comment section should now be visible on your live site!
